Physics Final Project Proposal

Red Circle:
	- player will have a motorized "shield" made up of 2 - 3 hinged spheres

Blue Cirlce:
	- player projectiles will be rigid bodies with custom response for damage
	
Not Shown in Picture:
	- an animated "object", most likely a mech but if i can't find one that will work it will
		be an animated person with rigid bodies on the limbs and torso for collision response
	
	- a slider with a motor as an obstacle that does damage 
	
	- if i get enough time i will try to make a different kid of projectile that will have two rigid bodies constrained to eachother,
		most likely 6 degrees of freedom
